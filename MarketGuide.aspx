  <img src="images/Provider-Mail.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Make sure to send your &quot;Friendly URL&quot; to your existing clients – you will find this on the bottom of all the emails we send you. This is very important, as many Seekers will only give work to Providers with feedback; it also cuts our commission to only 5% if you are credited with their introduction.   Remember to set-up your NOTIFY ME settings. We will then notify you automatically whenever someone requests your listed skill sets.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/Provider-my.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" /><a href="ProfileGuide.aspx">Create a great profile</a> , with a good <a href="PhotographGuide.aspx">photograph</a> or, better yet, a good profile and service videos. The aim is not to be found on every search, but to be found by every <strong>relevant</strong> search. You do not want everybody contacting you, but only those that are seeking your skills. In this way no one&rsquo;s time is wasted.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/Service.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Make sure that you describe your service accurately and provide excellent services that match those descriptions. This is the best way to ensure positive feedback. Good feedback encourages not only more business, as many <em>Seekers</em> prefer to select based on feedback, but it also improves your ranking, so that you are found more frequently. Good feedback also enables you to increase your charges.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/video.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Create good videos. With a webcam it is easy to record a simple video. Make sure that you sit close enough to the camera so that your face and expressions are clearly visible. It is best to arrange good lighting, use the best microphone that you have available to you, and have a plain background. Prepare flash cards to prompt you and then speak naturally, but with enthusiasm about your area of expertise, giving detail of experience, qualifications and even past work. Also, clearly state what areas you feel you can help with. Post the video on the site and indeed other sites such as Youtube and create links back to your profile with an <strong>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></strong> avatar.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/Seeker.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Do not try to keep a <em>Seeker</em> on the line if you know you are not helping them. While keeping them on the line will increase your charges on that call, it will lead to poor feedback. Poor feedback is very damaging to your profile and will badly damage your earning potential. Try to assess the <i>Seeker's</i> need before you start charging so that you can be confident in your response. Then, if you need to prepare or carry out research before your session, you can do so.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/Free-1st-Session.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Offer a free introductory session. This is very much a judgment call and depends on the nature of your service. However, free introductory sessions allow you to demonstrate your competence and build rapport. These sessions can often be short, but should be long enough for you to fully appreciate the <em>Seeker&rsquo;s</em> needs and establish your ability to help them. This allows you to prepare well for your first paid-for session with that <em>Seeker</em>.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/recommendation.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Seek <a href="FeedbackGuide.aspx">recommendations</a>. <em>Seekers</em> that qualify to give you a recommendation can be invited to write about their experience of your  service. <em>Seekers</em> looking at your profile can see these recommendations and reach a greater degree of comfort as to the reliability of your service.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/Download.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Create great products that can increase your credibility as a <em>Provider</em> and introduce a new income stream for yourself.<br/><br/><br/>
  <img src="images/net-Presence.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />Make good use of your <em><a href="MemberPages/NetPresence.aspx">Web Presence</a></em> links. This feature will help you, as it addresses a common fear on the Internet: &ldquo;who am I really dealing with?&rdquo;. In the offline world we are able to visit offices and get a feel for who a person is and the organization that he or she works for. Online, we need to work hard to create that confidence. Through the <em>Provider</em> profile and other information provided on the site, <em>Seekers</em> create a  picture of whom they are  dealing with. However, your giving access to your <em>Web Presence</em> helps bring your off line reputation online and is a critical step in building confidence.<br/><br/>
  <img src="images/db.png" alt="" class="leftImage" width="50px" height="50px" />We provide a &quot;Friendly URL&quot; linking to your profile. This is a key tool for you. It helps you in two ways. If a <em>Seeker</em> arrives to your profile using your &quot;Friendly URL&quot; and  registers on that visit, he or she will be classified as &ldquo;referred <em>Seeker</em>&rdquo;. <strong>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></strong> charges only 5% commission on all referred <em>Seekers</em>. Thus, wherever the &quot;Friendly URL&quot; is followed from: your email, blog, company website or even social networking site, you will be eligible for that commission discount.<br/><br/>
