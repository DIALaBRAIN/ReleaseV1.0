<p class="headingsNew">Services Through Our Website</p>
<p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px">
Users provide information during the process of using the <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> service. We break down users of our service into two categories, <i>Seekers</i> and <i>Providers</i> (you may register as both a <i>Seeker</i> and a <i>Provider</i>). Users are requested to provide contact information, such as name and mailing address and email address registered with PayPal as well as VAT status, if applicable, and country of domicile, in order for <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> to handle invoicing and payments. The information we collect from <i>Seekers</i> and <i>Providers</i> is to provide our users with the best possible service. If, for any reason, we have any issues with providing that service, we may use contact information to get in touch with the user.

<p class="headingsNew">Seeker - Provider Communication Using the <span style="color: #fff; font-weight: bold">DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></span> Service</p>
<p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px">
The main purpose of <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> is to provide a forum that enables registered <i>Providers</i> to provide registered <i>Seekers</i> with services that <i>Seekers</i> request. <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> hosts live video conversations, email exchanges and scheduling between <i>Seekers</i> and <i>Providers</i> through its website. In the process, <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> may disclose the full name and other potentially relevant data of its registered users for invoicing and payment purposes, but does not otherwise share information other than what is necessary for the proper execution of the transaction. <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> does not screen or edit the content of communications between <i>Seekers</i> and <i>Providers</i>, although we and certain of our platform suppliers may have the technical capacity to do so. Such communications are personal and private unless both parties agree to additional distribution. <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> keeps information relayed between the <i>Seeker</i> and the <i>Provider</i> confidential. No other users of <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> have access to this information.
</p><br />
<p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px">
Certain <i>Providers</i> may place on our website their own user-generated content or other links in respect of the services they provide. <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b> does not release any personal information regarding our users to such <i>Providers</i> or to such linked web sites, which, in any event, are neither affiliated with nor supported by <b>DIALa<span class="highlight2">BRAIN</span></b>. If you click on any such links, we cannot assume any responsibility for the way such sites handle your personal data or privacy.
