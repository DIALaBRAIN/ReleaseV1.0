Dear [ReceiverName],
<br /><br /><span>
Thank you for registering as a service Provider on <b> DIALa<font color="#ff912d">BRAIN</font></b>.  We are excited to welcome you on board and over the coming weeks, months and years we want to help you to drive traffic to your profile.<br />
</span>
<p style="padding-left:0px;margin-left:0px;">
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13px;">To get you started, here is your personalised friendly URL.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="[friendlyURL]"><img src="[dbImage1]" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="[friendlyURL]"><img src="[dbImage2]" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="[friendlyURL]"><img src="[dbImage3]" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />  <br />  
</p> 
<b>Great News - pay only 5% commission on clients that you invite to the site. </b>If any of your existing or new contacts click on this link, they will be taken to your personal profile on site.  If they then go on to register on the site on that same visit, then those users will be permanently associated with your account as "referred" by you.   The "referral" status is our way or recognising that it was your marketing efforts that drove these clients to the site.<br />  <br />  

To create the best impression please make sure you load a good photograph of yourself, ideally one or more short videos profiling you and your services and complete your profile. However, if you send out the link before you have loaded your photo or created a service, the association will still work, but we will navigate your referrals to our home page. This way they will not see an incomplete profile, after all, you only get one chance to create a first impression. <br />  <br />  

There are three different sizes of icons to copy and paste.<br /> <br /> 
<b style="color:#336699;">We suggest that you add the icon to your:</b><br /> 
 
    	<ul style="margin-left:50px;">
			<li>Email signature file</a></li>
			<li>Linkedin</a></li>
			<li>Facebook</a></li>
            <li>Blog and Blog posts</a></li>
            <li>Company website</a></li></ul>		 
Simply copy and paste one of the three icons to start driving traffic to your profile.<br />  

On some sites such as Linkedin they do not allow the loading of icons. In those cases here is your unique friendly URL that you should use.<br />  
[friendlyURL]

<br /><br />
Kind regards,<br />
